# myWebsite


One of my first website attempts in Django. 

The main functionality included a Calendar for booking events and appointments.

It included a REST API to interfacce with an Android Mobile App as well as an alerting mechanism through SMS!

This site was hosted on PythonAnywhere but I have not maintained it since 2018 and decided to terminate the website.
